Strateachy is a lesson planning program that tries to help teachers by making classes easy to plan and make unique while also trying to cater to the specific needs of the group. Plans for individual lessons are built by adding and specially editing activities that can be easily made and saved for later use or shared in the community. The lesson plans will also try and help teachers benefit the specific needs of the class by providing easy to use and edit templates that show the overarching learning objectives that are planned before adding specific activities.

* Specially designed for Suzuki (music) group classes.
* Works for any class that is a collection of smaller activities.
